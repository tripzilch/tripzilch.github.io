# COSMIC DANCE PARTY

with one foot in infinity.  

from side to side,  
to **side** to side,  
to **side**.  
the points of **light**  
shine lines,  
and beams,  
and strips,  
and streams,  
and sheets,  
and planes.  
until they birth  
space filling curves.  
that shoot bright white smiles into a multitude of mirror shaded faces  
reflecting into a parallel universe where beats are once more broken...  

this is a cosmic **dance** party.
