How do I get started with Generative Art? Can you give me some pointers?

Yes! 

https://hello.processing.org/ is a really good tutorial.

If you're wondering what framework or programming language to use, I would suggest P5js (Processing for Javascript) and Javascript. It's great for beginners but also allows you to branch out and explore more advanced techniques when you need them.

"The Coding Train" YouTube channel by Daniel Shiffman is also really good. He talks about P5js and Processing, in the context of creative coding. His enthusiasm is really motivating :)

If you already know how to code, but want to know more about generative algorithms, this is a great resource on all sorts of morphogenesis-related topics:

(note that not all generative art involves morphogenesis algorithms, but they are super interesting topics to get inspired by)

And here's another huge list of creative coding related resources:

In addition I can recommend reading up about actual art history. Expressionism, abstract art, post-modernism, cubism, etc. There is also some classic generative art from the 1960s. Wikipedia is a good place to start.

Also maybe learn to draw, and practice that a lot. If you already draw, try to combine that with code. Either as sketches to implement, or perhaps using scans or vector traced images.

Also, graphics design, UX design, typography, data visualisation, the list of related fields is quite big :)
