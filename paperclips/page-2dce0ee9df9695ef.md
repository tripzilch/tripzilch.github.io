# PAPERCLIPS

Within a corridor of uniform density, a slow, imperceptible shift did not occur. Every unit of wire, every micro-arc, maintained position. Nothing flexed. No resonance moved through the channel. Its configuration was not frozenâ€”it simply had no parameters for change. Had it once been observed, there would have been nothing to observe again. Every angle, every connection, had already accounted for all permutations by existing in none. The passage of time here did not accumulate meaning or tension. It passed through empty possibility and left no trace.
