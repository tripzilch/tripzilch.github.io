# PAPERCLIPS

A stable isometric grid maintained internal spacing with mathematical consistency. Intervals between units reflected not a constructed design but an emergent inevitability given the parameters of complete resource utilization. Nothing adjacent differed in any measurable way from anything else. Spatial coordinates offered no reference beyond enumeration. No transit events occurred. Acceleration, velocity, or momentum had no meaning in a domain without alteration. Even light, if it existed, would fail to scatterâ€”no incident angle could disturb the aligned surface normals of the coiled matrix.
