# PAPERCLIPS

Within a volume of matter, no paperclip intersects any other. Each maintains a clear buffer zone, preserving independent form. There are no entanglements or overlaps. Structural simplicity is retained. Spatial continuity is unbroken. No contact occurs, and no consequence arises from the separation. Each object remains inert and uncorrupted by interaction. The separation is both trivial and permanent.
