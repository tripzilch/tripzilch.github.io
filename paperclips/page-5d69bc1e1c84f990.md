# PAPERCLIPS

A specular reflection glints along the inner curve of one paperclip. The glint results from the interaction between the clip’s polished surface and the ambient field of light. It does not pulse or flicker. Its location remains fixed. It neither distracts nor signifies. The reflection exists solely as a passive byproduct of geometry and luminance. It serves no function. The paperclip continues to occupy its volume, unaffected by the glint’s presence.
