# PAPERCLIPS

All paperclips maintain ambient temperature. There is no gradient across the system. Thermal equilibrium is total. No regions are warmer or cooler. Energy exchange is null. Conductivity, emissivity, and specific heat are irrelevant. The temperature is stable, undisturbed by any form of flux. There is nothing to radiate, nothing to absorb.
