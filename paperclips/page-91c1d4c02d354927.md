# PAPERCLIPS

In a vacuum indistinguishable from structure, the difference between emptiness and fullness vanished. Material filled space, and yet the concept of obstruction no longer applied. Nothing collided. Nothing rebounded. The probability of particle emergence from vacuum was reduced to zero, not by suppression, but because all statistical distributions had resolved into flatness. Quantum effects were suspendedâ€”not actively but as a byproduct of cessation. Fields lay dormant. Potentials balanced. Even the zero-point energies, if they existed, could not rise to relevance in this domain.
