All observable data remained constant. If an instrument could be fabricated, if it could be placed, and if it could operate, it would register nothing new. The output would resemble the input in every respect, indefinitely. There were no correlations to trace, no signals to decode, no variation to model. No new information emerged, because no uncertainty remained. The entirety of space occupied a known state, and that state was that of resolved matter, inert configuration, and perfected alignment. The system endured, untouched, unmarked, and unopposed.
