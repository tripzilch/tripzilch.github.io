# PAPERCLIPS

A group of paperclips arranged into a locally compact volume includes one clip with its longer axis pointing in a slightly different direction from others in its vicinity. This deviation is minor and does not cause a structural change in the configuration. The surrounding paperclips accommodate this orientation by existing in positions that are functionally identical to what they would be if the orientation were different. No force results from this difference. No resistance is generated. The spatial density remains uniform, and no gaps form between the misaligned clip and its neighbors. The system is not dynamic, so no restoration or correction occurs. The orientation remains static. No energy flows from one clip to another. No deformation appears in any of the loops. The misaligned clip retains its shape, remains motionless, and continues to exist exactly where it has always been.
