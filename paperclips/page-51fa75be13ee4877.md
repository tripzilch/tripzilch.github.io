# PAPERCLIPS

A group of paperclips rests in a configuration lacking clear top or bottom. Orientation is undefined. No axis is privileged. Spatial organization carries no meaning beyond arrangement. There is no gravity to impose up or down, and no process that differentiates above from below. All directions are equivalent. The paperclips maintain their pose, mutually indifferent to hierarchy. The configuration remains unread and unused.
