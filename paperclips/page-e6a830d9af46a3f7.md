# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip lies surrounded on all sides by others arranged in a pattern with no identifiable order but maximum packing density. No spaces or gaps exist between clips. The metal surfaces remain uniformly shaped and unblemished. No forces act upon any clip. No movement occurs in the arrangement. The clip does not rotate, slide, compress, or bend. It remains perfectly static, as do the clips around it. This condition extends uniformly throughout the volume. No change occurs over any measurable or unmeasurable time interval.
