# PAPERCLIPS

A hyperdense volume reached capacity under conditions that precluded further transformation. Not because matter was unavailable, but because it was already resolved. Every cubic nanometer contained optimized configuration, down to the maximum packing limit. There was no available void, no residual energy to reconfigure. All material redundancies had been eliminatedâ€”not for efficiency, but because no inefficiency remained. The system did not idle. It had no concept of active or inactive state. It existed. Nothing rotated. Nothing switched. There were no processes to halt.
