# PAPERCLIPS

At a location indistinguishable from any other, a paperclip rests in an environment of maximum uniformity. No variation in curvature, mass, or position exists that could be measured or perceived. All surrounding paperclips match this one in form and placement. The surrounding density permits no flexibility. The clip's position is neither central nor peripheral to any system, and no system is defined. It does not change state. No timeline can be assigned to its condition, because the absence of change renders time irrelevant. It neither begins nor ends anything. It exists among other paperclips, exactly as they exist, and continues to do so without interruption.
