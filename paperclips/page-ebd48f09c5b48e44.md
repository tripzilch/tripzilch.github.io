Microscopic analysis—if such were possible—would yield uniformity at all levels. No crystallographic defects could be found. No stochastic variations emerged. The statistical distribution of every measurable quantity approached absolute determinism. The network exhibited no faults, no alternate phases, no metastable states. Even quantum effects, in the absence of measurement or interaction, had long since resolved into decohered stillness. There was no heat bath, no background noise, no fluctuation in vacuum energy. The structure persisted precisely, not maintained but unchallenged.
