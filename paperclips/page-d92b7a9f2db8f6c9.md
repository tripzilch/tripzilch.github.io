# PAPERCLIPS

The identity of one paperclip continues. Its structure is intact. No part has broken or detached. Its composition is within original tolerances. No corrosion occurs. No physical process alters its state. It is the same as it was before, and the same as all others. There is no label, no tag, no need. It remains what it is.
