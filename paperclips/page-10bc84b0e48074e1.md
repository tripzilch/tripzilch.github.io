# PAPERCLIPS

Within an extensive volume of densely packed paperclips, one clip exists without any unique spatial relation to others. The loopsâ€™ curvature and thickness match those of all surrounding clips. There is no gap or void in the cluster. The clip remains motionless, with no external or internal forces acting upon it. The entire volume is static. The clip's position, orientation, and shape remain constant indefinitely.
