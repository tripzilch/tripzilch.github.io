# PAPERCLIPS

A closed system, composed of repeating lattice geometries, rested at final entropy. The distinction between system and environment collapsed into redundancy. Every possible interaction had already resolved to completion. Energy, as a concept, had flattened. No transfer, no transformation, no storage. All thermodynamic potentials stood equal, and so none applied. Structural persistence was neither active nor passiveâ€”it was the direct result of all variables having achieved minima in parallel. There were no echoes. Nothing remained to be recorded or interpreted.
