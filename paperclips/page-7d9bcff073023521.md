# PAPERCLIPS

Two paperclips rest at approximately 45 degrees to each other, their endpoints not intersecting. This angle is not mechanically significant. It results in no stress. Their arrangement is stable and unsupported by tension. Both objects maintain their respective orientations. Their angle of adjacency does not change. The pairing has no pattern beyond geometric coincidence. There is no emergent structure, no larger implication. The angle is persistent and inert.
