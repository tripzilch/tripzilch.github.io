# PAPERCLIPS

Two paperclips are positioned such that their outer loops are nearly, but not quite, touching. The gap between them is minimal yet constant. No contact occurs. Their relative positions remain unchanged over time. There is no interaction, no movement, and no alteration in their arrangement. The paperclips exist in close proximity without influencing each other.
