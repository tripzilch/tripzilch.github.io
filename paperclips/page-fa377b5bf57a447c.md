# PAPERCLIPS

A stable configuration of elementary units maintained their positions relative to one another, neither strained nor relaxed, lacking even the memory of deformation. No external gradients imposed themselves upon the domain. Structural boundaries—if such could be defined—existed only as consequences of fixed coordinates, not as the result of differentiation. No interface conditions applied. Permittivity and permeability remained constant. No charge accumulation occurred. Every volume element had settled into a state where the sum of all potentials equaled null. There was no sequence. No prior. No next.
