# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is nestled among other paperclips with all sides in contact with the surrounding paperclips, leaving no part of it exposed to any void or opening. It remains in this position without exerting pressure or experiencing pressure beyond that which preserves the existing arrangement. Its shape is preserved entirely, with the inner loop maintaining its curved contour and the outer loop following the typical flattened arc. None of the adjacent paperclips have moved relative to this one. The density of the surrounding space is sufficient that no motion could occur without significant rearrangement, which does not take place. Every part of the paperclip continues to exist in the same spatial configuration as it did before. The adjacent paperclips do not exhibit any change in orientation. No tension or deformation builds. No release of energy or external interference happens. The paperclip remains a paperclip, located where it is, held in position by other paperclips that are also held in position by yet more paperclips.
