# PAPERCLIPS

Two paperclips lie in proximity such that the innermost arc of one is nearly, but not quite, touching the outer curvature of the other. The air—or absence thereof—between them is noninteractive. Molecular motion remains within standard thermal equilibrium. The separation is consistent across observations. Their relative orientation is offset by a slight angle, but neither initiates rotation nor translation. Their positions persist, not due to constraint but due to an absence of force. This distance remains constant across all measurable intervals.
