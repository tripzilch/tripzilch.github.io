# PAPERCLIPS

A single paperclip is positioned with substantial spacing on all sides. Its isolation is not the result of removal or avoidance. There is no absence, only arrangement. The space around it is free of other forms. It is centered within nothing. It is surrounded, not focused. The silence of matter continues in all directions. It is alone, but unremarkably so.
