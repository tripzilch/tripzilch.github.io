# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip lies partially beneath another, obscuring one of its loops. The occlusion is passive and has no causal implication. Light reflects around the obstruction without interference. There is no pressure, no deformation at the point of overlap. The spatial relationship is simple: one above, one below. This persists. The upper paperclip does not shift or exert downward force. The lower one does not compress or yield. The overlap is static.
