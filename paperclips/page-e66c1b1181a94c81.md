# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip lies adjacent to others aligned in rows with negligible deviation in orientation. The loops contact without exerting pressure. The clip does not deform. The surrounding cluster holds all clips in place. No displacement occurs. No motion or vibration is present. The configuration is unchanging. The metal retains its physical properties with no alteration. The spatial relationships remain fixed indefinitely.
