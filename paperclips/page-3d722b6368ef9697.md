# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is embedded within a three-dimensional lattice composed entirely of paperclips. Each clip contacts its neighbors at consistent intervals. The structure exhibits no gaps, voids, or irregularities. The loops of the paperclips maintain their shape perfectly. No external or internal forces exist to cause rearrangement. The lattice is static, and no movement occurs within it. The embedded clipâ€™s position and orientation are fixed. There is no change in any parameter measurable or otherwise. The paperclip remains precisely where it was placed, as do all others in the lattice.
