# PAPERCLIPS

A specific paperclip is surrounded by four others in a tetrahedral approximation, though the geometry is imprecise and irrelevant. No stress is present at the points of contact. The orientation of each clip is fixed. Their relative angles do not align to any external frame of reference, and no such frame is defined. The clips are not mechanically bonded, and yet none are capable of movement due to the density of the surrounding region. The central clip remains stable, supported evenly on all sides. The loops of each clip remain unbent and closed. There are no weak points. Nothing applies pressure in any direction. There is no rotation, no acceleration, no disturbance. The system does not tend toward any equilibrium because it already exists in a state of total stasis.
