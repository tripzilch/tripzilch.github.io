In the absence of opposing forces, the structural array persisted along all three axes without variation. Coherence extended isotropically. Symmetry was not an aesthetic or imposed constraint but an inevitable result of all divergence having been neutralized. No region displayed boundary effects. Edge conditions were undefined because no edge could be found. Matter had reached its most stable form and then ceased to require further adjustment. Signals, fields, and impulses were absent. Mechanisms of detection, if imagined, would fail to resolve any differential whatsoever.
