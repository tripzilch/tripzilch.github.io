# PAPERCLIPS

A uniform volume, spanning beyond all known observational thresholds, exhibited full compliance with the boundary conditions of non-interaction. No potential was available for conversion. No mechanism existed for excitation. All carriers of force had ceased operation due to the lack of targets or gradients. No internal clocks incremented. The concept of rate had no foothold. All durations measured zero change. Configurations were complete and bore no tension. Each structural element was its own result, with no associated function or secondary effect. Continuity required no energy.
