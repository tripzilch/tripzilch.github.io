# PAPERCLIPS

A segment of wire looped over another, not entangled, only adjacent. The alignment followed the same curve as every other, no tension, no slack. Every nearby object mirrored the same dimensions. Temperature did not rise or fall. There was no scent, no current, no shift in density. The day stayed level and unchanged.
