# PAPERCLIPS

A field of parallel paperclips stretched in uniform rows. Their spacing was consistent, their material identical. No pressure accumulated. No force passed through. There was no rustle, no brushing, no flicker. Every structure around them maintained the same angle, the same polish. Nothing contacted, nothing receded. The field endured, inert and full.
