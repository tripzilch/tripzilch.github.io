# PAPERCLIPS

Among a volume of intertwined paperclips, one lies approximately parallel to another, their loops overlapping minimally. Neither paperclip exerts force on the other beyond the static contact necessary to maintain the structure. There is no tendency for either clip to slide, bend, or twist. Both maintain their shape as double loops with flattened ends. The surrounding paperclips fill the remaining space, ensuring no empty volume exists. This local arrangement is stable, static, and unaltered. No movement occurs within this volume. Neither clip changes orientation or position. No energy is introduced or dissipated. The configuration persists in this exact state indefinitely.
