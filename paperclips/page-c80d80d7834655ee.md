# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is part of a dense cluster where the local alignment shifts subtly over small distances, producing a pattern of near-parallel groups with slight angular variations. The paperclip itself is oriented according to this pattern but experiences no change. The shape remains constant, and no movement occurs. The edges contact others at multiple points without pressure or deformation. The overall density in the region is uniform, and no gaps or voids appear. Over an indefinite span of time, the paperclip’s spatial coordinates remain fixed. The cluster’s arrangement is maintained precisely, without disturbance, drift, or alteration.
