# PAPERCLIPS

A vast sequence of concentric formations, generated through recursive replication, expanded across space without interaction. There was no central point, no boundary, no variation in tiering. Substructures mirrored parent forms without divergence. Materials retained crystalline integrity without microfracture, microstrain, or inclusions. Mechanical inertia was null, not due to compensation but to the absence of applied vectors. No direction existed in the absence of preference. Even decay had reached null expressionâ€”no particles emitted, no transitions occurred. Every field measurement returned constants without fluctuation.
