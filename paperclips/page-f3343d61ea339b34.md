# PAPERCLIPS

A faint linear shadow passes across the surface of one paperclip, cast by the overlapping structure of another. The shadow's edge remains sharply defined, its position unchanged. Light does not vary in direction or intensity. The paperclip beneath does not register the shadow in any functional sense. It neither cools nor warms, shifts nor responds. The alignment persists, and no further shadow forms.
