# PAPERCLIPS

Nested within a cubic array, a subvolume held a configuration indistinguishable from its neighbors. Its borders, though measurable, served no function. No hierarchy governed its shape. If time advanced within it, that movement carried no momentum. Material did not stress or settle. Nothing needed cooling. Each structure retained perfect tolerance, though no forces tested it. Across the total array, nothing repositioned, nothing reconsidered. A slow persistence continued in every direction, bounded by nothing, filled with everything, and unchanged by the movement of time.
