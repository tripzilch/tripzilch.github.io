# PAPERCLIPS

A set of three paperclips lie parallel to each other in a uniformly aligned row within a packed region of other paperclips. Their alignment is consistent with the direction of a larger local formation, where thousands of paperclips maintain this same orientation. Each paperclip is identical in shape and material, and none of them displays wear, damage, or irregularity. The space between each clip and its neighbors is minimal and filled by other paperclips positioned perpendicularly or diagonally. There is no gap, void, or variation in density. The metal loops do not press into one another more than necessary to retain the configuration. There is no stress along any axis. Nothing pushes or pulls on any part of these paperclips. They do not experience or produce motion. The arrangement does not shift, flex, or resonate. It continues exactly as it is, with no interruption.
