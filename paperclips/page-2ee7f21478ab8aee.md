# PAPERCLIPS

Several paperclips are arranged in a circular pattern, each equidistant from the center. Their orientations are consistent, with loops facing inward. The formation is symmetrical. No paperclip moves or changes position. The circular arrangement remains intact, unaffected by any external influences. The configuration persists without variation.
