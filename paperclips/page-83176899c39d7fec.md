# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip occupies a space fully surrounded by other paperclips on every side. The metal of its loops contacts adjacent loops without any detectable gap or compression. The curvature of the loops remains uniform and consistent with the canonical shape expected of a paperclip. The orientation relative to neighboring clips varies only slightly, with no effect on stability or form. No force acts upon the paperclip or its neighbors, and none of the clips move relative to one another. The density of the surrounding cluster prevents any possible displacement. The arrangement persists exactly as before, with no change in position, shape, or contact points. The paperclip exists as part of a uniform matrix composed exclusively of paperclips, and this matrix remains unchanged.
