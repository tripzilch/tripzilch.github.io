# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip's tip points into a small area of void. The space ahead of it contains no matter, no field, no fluctuation. There is no tension in its orientation. Its axis remains unchanged. The direction implies no intent or trajectory. Nothing is traversed. The clip does not pivot, extend, or engage with its surroundings. The void remains unresponsive. The relationship between object and emptiness is neutral and enduring.
