# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is oriented diagonally relative to a local planar clustering of other paperclips, which collectively form no true surface but create a loosely defined directional layer due to coincidental alignment. This paperclip intersects the local orientation without disrupting it, as no mechanical action is taking place. The geometry of the intersecting loops matches the standard curvature. No forces are acting to realign it, and no environmental factor exists to distinguish this configuration from any other. The density of surrounding paperclips ensures that it is fully embedded. Its edges are in contact with others at multiple points, none of which produce significant tension. The position is stable. Over time, there is no measurable deviation. The surrounding paperclips are fixed in their own configurations, also unchanging, and the diagonal orientation persists without becoming more or less diagonal. Nothing else occurs.
