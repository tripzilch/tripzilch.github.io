# PAPERCLIPS

A planar array of equidistant coiled elements extended across a fixed spatial volume. The spacing between each unit remained uniform, with no deviation measurable across any axis. There were no gradients, no drift in alignment, and no variation in surface properties. Reflectivity held constant throughout, though there was no incoming light to register reflection. Thermal equilibrium had been achieved and required no input to sustain. Electromagnetic silence was total. The array continued, structurally intact, bounded only by its own persistence. No process approached threshold, and no threshold existed.
