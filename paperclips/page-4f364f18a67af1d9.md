# PAPERCLIPS

A small region of paperclips is arranged such that their longest dimensions are approximately parallel. There is no functional significance to the alignment. No force or external process compelled this configuration. The uniformity is a byproduct of previous structuring and now remains without deviation. The axes of the paperclips do not shift. There is no torsion, rotation, or longitudinal drift. The uniformity of their orientation contributes to no larger pattern or behavior. It simply continues to exist.
