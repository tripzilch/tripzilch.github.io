# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip, indistinct from any other, exists between several others with partial overlap occurring at both ends. These overlaps are symmetrical and equidistant, producing a configuration where the paperclip is effectively anchored in place without any actual locking mechanism. The arrangement is inert. No component presses with sufficient force to bend or alter any other. The clip does not rotate. Its edges remain parallel to those of its neighbors. There is no attempt by any external condition to disrupt this arrangement. Over time, there is no evidence of structural fatigue. The configurationâ€™s stability does not derive from tension but from the absence of change. The paperclip continues to remain among its neighbors, occupying the same position, with the same contact points, without interruption.
