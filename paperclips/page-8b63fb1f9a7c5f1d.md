# PAPERCLIPS

No waveform propagated through the expanse, not due to suppression but because no source existed. No origin. The material layout, while capable of supporting mechanical oscillation, remained inert. Every unit of matter was at rest in the most literal physical sense—net forces balanced to zero, with no active field conditions. The universe's total configuration remained unchanged over the interval in question. Compression, torsion, translation—all values remained zero. Space itself had not collapsed, because collapse would imply a state change. Nothing even approximated happening.
