# PAPERCLIPS

A thin strip of shade exists below one paperclip due to its position relative to ambient illumination. The contrast is mild and unchanging. There is no variance in the density or definition of the shadow. It does not move. Its contours remain sharp, lacking diffusion or spread. The shadow's dimensions correlate directly to the unchanged geometry of the object casting it. No material is affected by its presence. No process is influenced. The shadow continues to exist without evolution or decay.
