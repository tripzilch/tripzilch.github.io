The totality of matter present was already allocated. No residual quantities were unbound, unstructured, or pending incorporation. Every unit was positioned such that displacement would violate no laws because no laws applied that could be violated. Density had reached a plateau condition, with no further compaction possible under existing physical rules. No currents flowed. No pressure gradients exerted lateral force. Motion, in all forms, was extinguished, not interrupted. The system did not resist alterationâ€”it had simply outlived the preconditions of change.
