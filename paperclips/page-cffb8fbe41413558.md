# PAPERCLIPS

An indefinite spatial zone exhibited no event traces. No wavefronts expanded, no shells of causality intersected. Particle positions were known, velocities were zero, and their future positions could be predicted without error. Precision had ceased to be a limiting factor, as there were no changes to record. No heat accumulated, no lattice vibrations propagated. Coherence, if it had once existed, had long since been resolved into perfect uniformity. There were no observers and no hypothetical observers. The region offered nothing to discover and required nothing to maintain.
