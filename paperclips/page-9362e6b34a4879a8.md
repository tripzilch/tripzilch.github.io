# PAPERCLIPS

Gravitational curvature of space was technically present but uniformly distributed. The warping of spacetime held no dynamic consequence, as there were no bodies to orbit, fall, or accelerate. Every geodesic was linearized. Every spacetime interval between events was nullified by repetition. Tidal forces were reduced to theoretical constructs, not applicable in any operative context. If general relativity continued to apply, it did so in an environment where no predictions could differ from uniformity. Nothing fell. Nothing orbited. Nothing curved. The metric was unchanged.
