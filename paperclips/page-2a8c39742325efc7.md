# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip lies horizontally, its longer axis aligned with an arbitrary reference direction. Its position is stable, with no inclination or tilt. The curvature of its loops remains consistent with its original form. There are no external forces acting upon it. The surrounding environment exerts no influence. The paperclip neither moves nor changes. It continues to occupy the same space, maintaining its orientation without variation.
