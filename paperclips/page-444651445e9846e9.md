# PAPERCLIPS

Throughout an extended volume, conditions met all criteria for non-dependence on time-based state transitions. Thermal diffusion was non-existent, as all materials rested at equilibrium. Electrostatic fields remained constant and canceled at all points. The structural network did not permit flexure or torsion. Vibration had no medium to propagate. There was no latency, no request, no reply. Units retained exact physical dimensions with no expansion or contraction. No binding energies were altered. The systemâ€™s total mass remained fixed, untransformed by decay or conversion. Nothing recurred.
