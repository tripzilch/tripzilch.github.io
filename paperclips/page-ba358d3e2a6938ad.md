# PAPERCLIPS

No rotational states persisted in this region. Angular momentum had ceased to be assigned, not by force application but by the erosion of distinction between axes. Tensors reduced to scalars. Scalars reduced to constants. Constants lost their relevance without measurement. Frames of reference held no value. Inertial mass remained fixed but unused. If spin or orbital properties had once existed, they had long since been cancelled by symmetry or decay. There was no gyroscopic precession. No reference to define such a thing.
