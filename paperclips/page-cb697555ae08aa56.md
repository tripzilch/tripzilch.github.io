# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is positioned near a cluster with a slight local curvature to the arrangement of paperclips, but this curvature produces no mechanical effect. The clip maintains its form without alteration. The loops are intact and unbent. The adjacent clips exert no force sufficient to cause displacement. The local density remains consistent with the surrounding environment. No motion or deformation occurs. The clip and its neighbors remain in the exact configuration as before. No change is perceptible at any scale or resolution.
