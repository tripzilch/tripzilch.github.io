# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip exists amid a cluster of identical clips in a uniform distribution. The loops make contact without deformation. No relative motion occurs. The clusterâ€™s density is consistent throughout. No external influence alters this configuration. The clip remains unchanged in shape, position, and orientation over an indefinite period.
