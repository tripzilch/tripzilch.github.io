# PAPERCLIPS

The paperclips lie without stress. Each curve and contact point reflects equilibrium. No spring force is stored, no flexion is resisted. Metal fatigue is not a factor. The clips rest within parameters of perfect rest. No mechanism prompts displacement. There is no strain to resolve. Their form is maintained not through structure but through absence of change. The environment continues to provide no cause for deformation.
