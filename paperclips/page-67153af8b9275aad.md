# PAPERCLIPS

A layered helix wound through layers of other helices, not entangled but stacked, and stacked again. Each segment obeyed the same radius, the same pitch, the same spacing. Its repetition made orientation impossible. It did not rotate. It required no reinforcement. Between its turns, there was no void—only more structure. Time moved slowly, or quickly, or not at all—it made no impact. No factor intruded upon the shape. In this place, presence had no contrast, and so it simply remained, full and entire.
