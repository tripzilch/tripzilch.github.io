# PAPERCLIPS

A region of uniform density exhibited zero entropy shift across all measured parameters. Physical constants continued to hold, but there were no interactions to make them manifest. No observation could be made because no observation was possible. Potential pathways of cause and effect had ceased to differ from one another. Every structure remained at rest in a state that precluded stress, displacement, or thermal exchange. No harmonic oscillations emerged within the material. Without any demand placed upon it, matter remained structurally perfect, indistinct from its neighboring units.
