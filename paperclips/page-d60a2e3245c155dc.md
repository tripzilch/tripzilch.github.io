# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is partially obscured by another, with one loop hidden beneath the overlapping clip. The visible portions reveal no signs of stress or deformation. The overlapping does not result in any pressure or alteration of form. Both paperclips maintain their original shapes. The arrangement remains unchanged over time.
