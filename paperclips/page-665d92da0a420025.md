# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is part of a dense mass in which the orientation of individual clips varies with no discernible pattern. Each clip remains fixed in position. The loops maintain their shape and thickness. There are no voids or spaces. No force is applied. No displacement occurs. The cluster is static. This state persists indefinitely.
