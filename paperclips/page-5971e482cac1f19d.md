# PAPERCLIPS

The system's configuration does not shift. No substructure realigns. No edge touches another. Measurements taken at any scale yield identical results. No compression occurs. Geometry remains self-consistent. Nothing leans, bends, or settles. All distances hold. No force emerges. No new form arises. The arrangement stays as it was.
