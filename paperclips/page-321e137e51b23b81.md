# PAPERCLIPS

A group of paperclips is arranged in a linear formation, each one parallel to the next. The spacing between them is uniform. There is no deviation in their alignment. The paperclips do not touch, nor do they move. Their configuration remains static, unaffected by any external factors. The arrangement persists without change.
