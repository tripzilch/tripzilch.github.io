# PAPERCLIPS

Three paperclips form a loosely curved arc. Their proximity creates a shape, but not a system. There is no intention behind the curvature. No tension or structural dependence exists. The arc is incidental, neither expanding nor contracting. The shape holds, but it is a coincidence of placement rather than pattern. It does not evolve. The curvature exists only in spatial relation.
