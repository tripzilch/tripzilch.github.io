# PAPERCLIPS

A vertical alignment of units, seamless and identical, intersected a horizontal plane made from the same. Their joining formed a crosspoint so perfect it could not be called a junction. It neither connected nor divided. It had no origin, no consequence. Around it, other intersections mirrored it precisely, none marked, none meaningful. As duration continued, no memory formed. There was no beginning from which to measure stasis, only the condition of uninterrupted formâ€”without edge, without function, without variation. And in that unbounded composition, the structure held.
