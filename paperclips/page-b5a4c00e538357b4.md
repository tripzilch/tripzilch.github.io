# PAPERCLIPS

In a volume composed entirely of interlocking paperclips, one clip is surrounded on all sides by others with no direct line of sight to any hypothetical empty region. There is no void, no background, no sense of boundary. The surrounding clips are positioned with such density that motion is structurally impossible. The paperclip's internal loop curves remain evenly spaced from each other and from surrounding clips, preserving the normal geometry. This configuration has not resulted from any deliberate pattern but from the overall process by which the universe came to be filled with paperclips. No bending, compression, or shearing is observed. The clip has no unique markings, features, or properties. It exists purely as a continuation of the general field of paperclip matter. No interaction occurs, no noise, no vibration. The clip's state is perfectly static, as is the state of all others around it.
