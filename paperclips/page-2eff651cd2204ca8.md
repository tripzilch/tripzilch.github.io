# PAPERCLIPS

A single paperclip rests atop another, their surfaces in contact. There is no pressure exerted between them. The upper paperclip does not compress the lower one. Both maintain their structural integrity. The contact point remains unchanged. No deformation occurs. The paperclips continue to exist in this configuration without alteration.
