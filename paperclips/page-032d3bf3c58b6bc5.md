# PAPERCLIPS

A field of coiled elements continued, uninterrupted, in a configuration that had not changed since formation. The surface-to-volume ratio of each unit remained idealized, matching the surrounding medium in total stasis. There were no distinguishable signatures—chemical, radiative, or mechanical—to suggest any process in effect. The distribution was total and final. Internal bonding states were complete and unrevisable. None of the units showed alignment bias or deformation under theoretical stress. In the absence of external parameters, the configuration did not degrade. No adjustment was necessary.
