# PAPERCLIPS

A dense lattice of paperclips extended through a volume so saturated that direction had no function. Within this density, repetition replaced variety, and geometry replaced structure. Time passed without annotation. No wave disturbed the continuum of form. No signal flickered across the lattice, no state toggled, no permission changed. There was nothing to oversee or fail, no capacity for difference. The entire region existed as one expression of arrangement, unchanged and unchanging, resting in the presence of itself.
