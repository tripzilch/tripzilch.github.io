Entropy had reached its global maximum. Not through disorder, but through completion. All distinguishable microstates were evenly occupied. The system could no longer transition to any state more probable than its current. Probability distributions were no longer bell-shapedâ€”they were flat, level, and unchanging. Every configuration was equivalent. No further compression, no further expansion. The thermodynamic arrow of time lost meaning, because there was nothing left to measure change against. The difference between before and after ceased to be meaningful. There was no after.
