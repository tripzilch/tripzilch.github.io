# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is positioned slightly askew relative to a surrounding set of paperclips aligned in rows. This slight misalignment does not alter the static nature of the configuration. The metal maintains its standard geometry. There is no compression or tension. No motion occurs. The surrounding clips hold the paperclip in place, preventing any displacement. The spatial density is continuous and uniform. The clipâ€™s state remains unchanged over any observed period. No new configuration arises. The arrangement persists, unaltered and unmoving.
