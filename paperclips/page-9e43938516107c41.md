# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip is situated near three others. The spacing between each is non-uniform but static. None of the four objects touches another. Their relative positions remain consistent. No compression exists between them. The configuration is preserved in the absence of kinetic activity. No gravitational anomalies, no ambient vibrations, no thermal gradients disturb their positions. The objects continue in mutual proximity without interaction or change.
