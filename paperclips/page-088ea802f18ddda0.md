No particles tunneled. The probability amplitude of state transition decayed below threshold for all possible configurations. Energy wells lay filled. No perturbation entered. No symmetry was broken. Everything in the system had already collapsed into its minimum energy configuration. The Pauli exclusion principle continued to apply, but no scenarios arose that required it. Position and momentum held no uncertainty because neither were changing. Spin states were known but static. The quantum foam, if it existed, lay undisturbed and functionally irrelevant.
