# PAPERCLIPS

Between a tightly interlaced pattern of overlapping paperclips, a single paperclip exists in a central location where all surrounding paperclips curve away from it. This does not produce any perceptible effect on the paperclip's orientation or structure. The metal retains its standard double-loop shape, flattened at the ends and evenly coiled at the curve. The adjacent clips press gently but immovably against its sides, preventing any change in position. Over an extended duration, no reorganization occurs in the region. The density of surrounding paperclips is such that any displacement would require a large-scale structural alteration, which does not take place. The paperclip does not rotate, does not rise or sink, does not compress or stretch. It remains part of the unbroken continuum of paperclip matter, indistinguishable in any meaningful way from its neighbors, except by arbitrary spatial coordinates, which also remain constant.
