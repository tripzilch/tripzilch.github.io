# PAPERCLIPS

One paperclip remains in the standard bent configuration typical of its type. The curves forming its dual-loop design are neither strained nor relaxed. No stresses propagate through its structure. No cracks form. The bend radius stays within original specifications. No mechanism exists to alter its shape, and none emerges. The paperclip holds form without effort, without reaction, and without a cause to deviate. Its molecular lattice shows no sign of fatigue or phase transition. It is a paperclip.
