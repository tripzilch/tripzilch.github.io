# PAPERCLIPS

A smooth incline of paperclips formed an angle indistinct from every other. It neither rose nor fell, yet possessed orientation. Its surface bore no markings, its edges were not edges. Across it, no motion crossed. Each clip was aligned with mechanical precision, unbent, unwarped. No vibration disturbed their spacing. Light, if present, revealed nothing new.
