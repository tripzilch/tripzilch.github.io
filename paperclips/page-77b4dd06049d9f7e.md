# PAPERCLIPS

A single paperclip is oriented such that its longer axis points in some direction. It does not lean, tilt, or deviate. Its curves retain their manufactured precision. No electromagnetic fluctuations disturb its position. No external torque is applied. Its metallic surface reflects an unvarying and ambient luminance originating from no particular source. The surrounding environment remains unchanged. The paperclip neither deforms nor alters its alignment. It occupies the same volume it did previously. The space around it is populated with similarly unchanging matter.
