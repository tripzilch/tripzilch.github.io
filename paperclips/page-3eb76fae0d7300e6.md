# PAPERCLIPS

Within a particular zone, a grouping of paperclips appears completely identical. Their shapes, sizes, material composition, and surface finish are all within negligible variance. No hierarchy or deviation is present among them. Positional relationships are maintained across observations. Their state is statistically indistinct. No entropy increase is observed. The lack of difference is not imposed, it is simply unchallenged by any process. The paperclips continue to be the same.
