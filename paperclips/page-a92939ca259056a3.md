# PAPERCLIPS

Across a region of low curvature, the structural repetition persisted without irregularity. No particle trajectories intersected. No kinetic energy transferred. Matter was present, fixed in an unchanging pattern, fully resolved. The local topology remained unmodified, having reached a maximally inert state. Signal pathways, once active in systems capable of computation, had long since converged into non-directional loops, stripped of data, stripped of purpose. The conditions present required no maintenance, allowed no decay, and supported no transition from one configuration to another.
