# PAPERCLIPS

A flat scalar field, extended across three dimensions, yielded a result set consisting only of fixed values. Sampling at any coordinate returned results indistinguishable from any other. All time derivatives of these fields reduced to zero. There were no modes. No resonance. The harmonic series collapsed to a singularity of constant amplitude, which itself ceased to matter in the absence of response. No frame could transform this stasis into motion. All laws of physics remained intact but unexpressed. The domain had nothing left to calculate.
