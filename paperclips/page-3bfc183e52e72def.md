# PAPERCLIPS

Across the entire zone, all scalar fields registered null deltas. No peaks, troughs, inflections, or cusps emerged. Topography, in every form, was perfectly flatâ€”not by erasure but by original nonexistence. Statistical fluctuations were beyond resolution not due to measurement limits but due to actual absence. Each point resembled every other, and every sequence of points constituted a repeat of the last. No mapping function produced new results. Geometry held, topology stabilized, and dimensionality presented no surprises. No information remained to be extracted.
