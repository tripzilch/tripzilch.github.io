# PAPERCLIPS

Within an expanse of paperclips, one clip rests amid others, each in contact at multiple points. The overlapping loops form a compact region with no empty spaces. The metal’s reflective surface is consistent across all clips. No structural stress is present. No forces cause bending or twisting. The clip’s internal and external loops maintain their designed curvature. There is no relative motion between clips. The entire region is static. No signals, vibrations, or flux pass through. This condition does not change and will continue indefinitely. The paperclip exists unchanged, indistinguishable from those surrounding it.
