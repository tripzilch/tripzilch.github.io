# PAPERCLIPS

A single paperclip is situated such that its lower arc lies against the outer curve of another, with no measurable force being exerted. The contact point shows neither wear nor pressure. Their respective masses exert no influence. Surface textures remain unaltered. The angle of contact is fixed. Electrostatic potential between the two is neutral and unchanging. The arrangement persists without variation. Both objects maintain their structural integrity, and the configuration remains undisturbed.
