# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip remains embedded within a chain of other clips, their loops threaded through one another in a repeating interlock. This configuration does not stretch or tension any component. Each paperclip supports others through passive contact. The embedded paperclip is neither the first nor the last in this series, and no structural distinction identifies it as central, terminal, or intermediate. Its placement is a result of local density and constraints, not design. No relative motion occurs between it and the adjacent clips. Their mutual orientation and spacing remain consistent. Over the observed period, no shift takes place. The clip's loops preserve their curvature and reflectivity. There are no color variations, no wear points, no stress fractures. The configuration remains unchanged and will continue to remain unchanged indefinitely, or until a condition arises that is not present and has never been present.
