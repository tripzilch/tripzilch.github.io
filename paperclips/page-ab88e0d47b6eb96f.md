# PAPERCLIPS

A cubic macrostructure, composed of smaller repeating subunits, extended in all directions without terminus. Its uniformity rendered internal mapping redundant. Spatial coordinates described positions, but not relationships. No temporal markers distinguished one layer from the next. Material identity was persistent but devoid of context. The structure neither emitted nor responded to external stimuli, as none were present. Its persistence was not an active process but a result of having eliminated all parameters which could enable variance. There were no cycles, no phases, no events.
