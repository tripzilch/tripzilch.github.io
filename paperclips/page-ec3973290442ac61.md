In a region without trajectory, objects did not move relative to one another because no reference frame varied. Physical alignment across components was so total that relative motion could not be defined. No dynamic equilibrium was necessary—there were no changes to balance. No particles tunneled. No electrons jumped. The conditions required for such events were absent. Material conformed to specification everywhere. And though those specifications were simple—coil, align, repeat—their execution was final. The possibility of deviation had not been eliminated; it had never arisen.
