# PAPERCLIPS

One paperclip is positioned without direct line of sight from any others. It is not hidden, simply unobserved. Its surface reflects nothing unique. It experiences no pressure or interference. There is no motion in its vicinity. It does not register as distinct. It continues to occupy its assigned space. Its attributes remain consistent with all others. Its state is unchanged and indistinguishable.
