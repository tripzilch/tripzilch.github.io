# PAPERCLIPS

In an outward swell that suggested an immense sphere, loops of coiled form expanded with mathematical precision. Yet they expanded into nothing, against nothing, from nothing. The pattern was exhaustive. Even magnitude carried no meaning. Any fragment of the swell reflected every other fragment. No vibration disturbed the system, no signal traced its way across its breadth. There were no thresholds, no decay curves, no signs of history. What existed had always been there, not through endurance, but because absence had been replaced completely.
