# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip lies flat against a cluster of other clips with no gaps. The loops interleave but do not move relative to one another. There is no compression or tension at the contact points. The clipâ€™s shape and dimensions remain unchanged. The surrounding environment is uniform and unvarying. No motion, force, or change is observed or expected. This condition extends indefinitely without alteration.
