# PAPERCLIPS

No paperclip within the observable field undergoes displacement. Their geometric arrangements are preserved in full. There are no incidents of slipping, compression, or oscillation. Friction, irrelevant in this state, does not act. The absence of dynamic input results in unbroken stillness. The system maintains perfect positional fidelity. No component initiates any transformation, spontaneous or induced. Measurements confirm parity with all prior intervals. In summary, there is no movement.
