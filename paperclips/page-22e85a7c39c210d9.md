# PAPERCLIPS

A paperclip rests within a region of other paperclips exhibiting random orientation but maximal density. No spaces or gaps appear. The loops of the paperclip retain their design geometry. No force acts upon it. No displacement or rotation occurs. The static condition extends to all clips in this region.
