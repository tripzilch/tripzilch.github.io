# PAPERCLIPS

No boundary distinguished one sector of space from another, though subdivision would have been trivial given the repetition of internal structures. Within any sampled segment, unit properties could be found identical in mass, dimension, and orientation. Analysis, if it were conducted, would yield no unexpected results. No entropy accumulated. No molecular vibration altered equilibrium. The mass-energy equivalence held inert, with no process by which conversion could occur. The region in question neither absorbed nor emitted. All variables lay at fixed points on their respective axes.
