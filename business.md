# Epihyperderpflardioids B.V.

## What is Epihyperderpflardioids B.V. and what does it do?

I am Piter Pasma, I am a digital artist since a very long time, I write computer programs that generate complex visual art pieces.

Epihyperderpflardioids B.V. is the name of the business I sell my art under.

## How do I buy your art?

If you'd like to buy one of my plots, or a print of my work, you can contact me via social media (@piterpasma on both Twitter and Instagram) to inquire about availability and to get a quote.

Since 2021 I have been able to sell my works as NFTs for crypto currencies. I do this on the Ethereum and the Tezos blockchain.

The NFTs function as a proof of authenticity and ownership, and also keeping record of the "provenance" (previous owners). This is important in the gallery, curator and art world.

You can find my NFTs on several marketplaces:

* Most of my works are on Tezos, and are available on [Objkt.com](https://objkt.com/profile/tz1Kw8cEFuNLj21e5b42NBn1ANW7hupmbDbo/collections), and have in large part been released on the [FXhash platform](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Piter%20Pasma) (currently sold out).
* On Ethereum I have released some works on [Foundation](https://foundation.app/piterpasma) as well as [Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/project/173) (sold out).

## Plans for the future

In the future I plan to release more artworks on the Art Blocks and FXhash platforms.
