# Artists On The Chain 

## 2025-08-16 Piter Pasma

Here's a bunch of artworks I've selected for my upcoming talk with Artists On The Chain, for Bobbi Bicker, Blockmuse and Kyt.

I had a hard time selecting because I've done so many different styles and things over the years and I'm not sure what will come up to talk about, so here's an overview.

## Early work (demoscene, 1997-2001)

For a very nice overview of my demoscene releases, see:

[https://demozoo.org/sceners/17360/](https://demozoo.org/sceners/17360/)

Two of my 4KB demos from that era have been recorded to YouTube: [Never Bored](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv-gHBz4hgw) and [Meuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYopuMRVN6Q). Also [this](/img/demoscene/ikamb99.jpg) is what I looked like back then.

## Older work 

After the demoscene I was mostly busy studying Computational Science at university, of course I kept creative coding, both with audio and graphics. I just had to get the creative juices out, also doing a bunch of graphics design and drawing loads of cartoons. Links to that on request.

It took until 2019 before I started sharing my generative art to the world again, registering an Instagram account and figuring I had something more interesting to post than pictures of my lunch.

*Hilbert Curve explorations. When I made these, I was contacted by a Danish graphics design agency who wanted to buy these designs for an upcoming electronic music festival in Copenhagen. The festival unfortunately never happened due to the pandemic, but I did get paid and this allowed me to buy my Axidraw plotter. It's also the first piece I sold as an artist (and for a not insignificant amount) so I am super proud of that.*

![Polygon subdivision experiment](poly-subdivq-s.jpg)
*Polygon subdivision experiment. I like this piece because it's a beautifully simple algorithm, I had not heard of before and gives very interesting results and forms I hadn't seen before. The algorithm is: 1. Find the largest polygon by area (starting with a rectangle filling the page) 2a. Split this polygon roughly in half. 2b. The parameter is "roughly", how uneven is the split. In the image here, I vary the evenness from top (very uneven) to bottom (very even).*

![Asteroid line cut](linecut-2020-10-12-15-19-38-s2160.jpg)
*Asteroid line cut. I like this piece because it's another beautifully simple algorithm leading to unexpected complexity.*

![Asteroid line cut algorithm](algo123.jpg)
*The idea is you draw a spiral, and then you draw a random line that slices it, and move the spiral apart, perpendicular to that line, while keeping all the lines connected. Seems simple enough but I could not image what it would look like if I repeated this process a few hundred times.*

## Epihyperderpflardioids

Today these warrant a special chapter. I've long been fascinated by these shapes. From an early age, as a budding generative artist, I played with the drawing game/toy [Spirograph](https://www.google.com/search?q=spirograph&tbs=imgo:1&udm=2) where you pin gears to a piece of paper, tracing them with a pen, creating beautifully intricate shapes.

Later I learned about sine and cosine waves and discovered the math behind these shapes and started building my own formulas. Traditional [Spirograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) shapes are usually categorized as "hypocycloids" or "epicycloids", but my formulas ventured outside of the possible shapes that can be made with only gears. So I decided to call my formulas, "Epihyperderpflardioids" instead.

You can also play with [Epihyperderpflardoids live on your phone](https://piterpasma.nl/epihyperderpflardioids/) <-- here. Seriously check this out, it's great fun. Please note to allow the page to read your phone's orientation sensor, because that controls them. Tap for a new image. 

Sometimes people ask me how to pronounce "epihyperderpflardioids", and now, thanks to the power of AI, I have created some audio samples: [Power Metal](EPIHYPERDERPFLARDIOIDS.mp3), [New Wave 1](EPIHYPERDERPFLARDIOIDS-newwave1.mp3), [New Wave 2](EPIHYPERDERPFLARDIOIDS-newwave2.mp3). This was just for fun.

## Skulptuur

At the beginning of 2021 I started working on Skulptuur. I'm a bit too tired to write much more about it now.

It's a photo realistic renderer for imaginary sculptures using only 6370 characters of Javascript code:

![Skulptuur's code](code-final4.png)
*Skulptuur's code*

It uses no libraries, no 3D models, no external input, nothing except those 6370 characters running in your browser to generate any of these 1000 sculptures.

Skulptuur was released on Art Blocks in September 2021. Check out the full gallery of 1000 outputs at [https://skulpturen.nl](https://skulpturen.nl)

## Rayhatcher

Technically I made the first version of my rayhatcher near the end of 2020, but I put it away for a while to work on Skulptuur. A year later when I took up the project again, I reimplemented everything, and I've always been struck by the atmosphere that even basic geometric forms acquire when rendered using this technique.

![Universal Rayhatcher 509](URH509-Onduidelijkheid_001.png)

I made various projects and 1/1s using the rayhatcher technique. The above images are from Universal Rayhatcher, which was a collaborative project, where artists could write their own mathmatical formulas (in 512 characters) to define a 3 dimensional scene. It was a really experimental idea, but so many people put their effort into it, and it was successful beyond my wildest expectations.

For even more info, also about the other projects, check out my article [Rayhatching Evolution](https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) about the history of my development of this algorithm. 

## Blokkendoos

Blokkendoos is maybe my favourite project I've done so far. It blends powerful coding and rendering technique with a beautiful generative algorithm.

## Impossible Sentinels

Impossible Sentinels is my most recent project. Again too tired to write more, so please [read the article I wrote about it](/impossible-sentinels/).

Here's a few outputs from it:
