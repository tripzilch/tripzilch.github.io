# the wrong way to draw a circle

overview

don't forget to ask questions
or if I'm unclear or go too fast

make my work through code

often generative, but sometimes not. there's a fine line, and a lot of crossover

## drawing circles

pendulum

sine and cosine https://www.desmos.com/calculator/wjg0pu4ulx
rotating point https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zkgrvjsytp

everything https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Circle_cos_sin.gif

the point is that cos and sin together make a circle of radius 1.0,
by rotating a point around the origin at distance 1.0.

## p5js

let's do this in p5js

### vector functions

p5 has a Vector object, but I don't like it and it's easy to implement your own

function vec2, vcircle, vdraw, vadd

### a strange way to draw a circle

points at random angles with a fixed radius

### a filled circle

but the distribution is wrong

how to fix --> magic?

### add another circle

now we have a thick circle

### let's have some fun and / or questions
