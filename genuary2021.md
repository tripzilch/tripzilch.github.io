Here's a list of all the prompts for each day. All of them can be found on [my Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/piterpasma/), but for some I specifically included an extra link, if it has extra variations on that piece which are also worth checking out. Definitely be sure to check out the links for the days that have live versions running on my website.

On the Instagram posts you can also read my motivation/reasoning about interpreting a prompt. But if you have any questions, just drop a comment and ask.

Live version: https://piterpasma.nl/gen1112 -- works on Android Chrome only, sorry I only had limited time, and I picked the wrong API :) lessons learned. but if you got an Android phone, check it out because it's really really cool.
* day 13. Do not repeat. [plot+video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKARzwDn9ZR/)

* day 14. Subdivision.
* day 15. Let someone else decide the rules of your piece. They told me to use the exponential function. I did things to it. [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKFVJc-HkCd/)
* day 16. Circles only. [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKIDWjAn8Bx/)
* day 17. Draw a line, pick a new color, move a bit. (I varied "texture" rather than the colour) [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKKDc7nHJki/)
* day 18. Growing & pruning 
* day 19. Increase the randomness along the Y-axis [plot+video](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKRg8BBn6v6/)

* day 20. No loops. [How I didn't use loops](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSB3QLneLc/)
* day 21. Given [this recursive function](https://genuary2021.github.io/prompts#jan21). [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKWIvdsn_eS/)
* day 22. Draw a line, wrong answers only.
* day 23. Use this colour scheme. [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKZA3E_HUrC/)
* day 24. 500 lines. [plotter timelapse](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKg9tkxHAVg/)
* day 25. Grid of permutations.

* day 26. 2D Perspective.
* day 28. Use sound. Live version: https://piterpasma.nl/gen28 Works best on computer, at least the timing gets messed up on my phone (again I would have fixed this if it weren't for time constraints).
Day 29. Any shape, none can touch.

Not in the collage:

Day 27. Monochrome gradients without lines. [variations](https://www.instagram.com/p/CK7D-amHm-J/)
Day 30. Replicate a natural concept. Haven't done this one yet.
Day 31. Obtain one of Eno's Oblique Strategies. Mine was "(blank white card)". Which gives me a carte blanche, I guess. I decided it will be whichever new piece I make next :-)
