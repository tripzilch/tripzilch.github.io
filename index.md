# You are here
*A CONCLUSION IS JUST WHERE YOU STOPPED THINKING*

Piter Pasma is a generative artist, expressing himself through experiments with code, complexity and a touch of chaos. Among the space of algorithms are buried gems in carefully tuned black boxes, concrete trap doors leading to unexpected dungeon forests, only seen when you open them a thousand times, sideways. 

Starting as a demoscener in 1998, he wrote four prize-winning 4 kilobyte demos (non-interactive real-time size-constrained audio-visuals). Since then he has been honing his creative coding skills, and recently has been exploring the challenges of realising his works physically by means of a robot plotter.

## art

For now, the best place to see my art is to check out [my Instagram Profile](). Sending me a message on Instagram or Twitter is currently probably also the best way to contact me, for questions about sales or collaboration.

In the future there will be a gallery page and other cool stuff on this very website. Because Instagram is not supposed to the canonical place to find my art.
