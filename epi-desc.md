EPIHYPERDERPFLARDIOIDS is the name I have given to a large family of symmetrical loopy shapes, based on sine waves and rotations, reminiscent of the mathematical toy/game "Spirograph", but also different. The name is based on the words Epicycloid and Hypocycloid which are mathematical names for somewhat related shapes.

I started out by playing with formulas for shapes based on sine waves. Adding cosine waves gets you rotations. Add more sine waves and you get wobbles. The possibilities were literally endless and I felt I needed some direction. I noticed some of my formulas resulted in symmetrical shapes, while others did not. So I decided on the possibilities that keep symmetry, which led me down quite a fun rabbit hole.

Their main shapes are determined by two sticks attached end to end, that rotate at two different frequencies, drawing the path of the end point of the second stick. The first stick may rotate around the origin twice, and the second stick may rotate around the end-point of the first, three times. Because of reasons, this will generate a shape with five-fold symmetry. There are additional ways to "modulate" the sticks, such as periodically changing their length or rotation speed. In order to keep the symmetry, these modulations will need to have a frequency of five.

The result are very playful, harmonic looking, curly shapes that have a huge amount of variety within their specific parameters.


I studied them extensively, but don't claim to understand them fully, yet. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
